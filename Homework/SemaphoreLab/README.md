# Building things

All the files in this lab can be built like this:

    gcc -pthread -ggdb threadSort.c -o threadSort.bin

(replace threadSort.c with whatever file we're talking about).  I
encourage you to create some Makefiles as needed but its up to you.

# Thread Factoring (20 points)

Look in the thread\_factoring project in the Homework/SemaphoreLab
directory.

Start by understanding the code in threadExample.c (you may have seen
this example already, but if not review it).

Then use threads to parallelize the problem given in factoring.  If
you do it correctly you should be able to see the correct number of
threads working in parallel.

Here's some sample output from my solution.  Note that when given two
threads, my solution will make one thread handle evens and one thread
handle odds.  Your approach does not have to split up the problem this
way, as long as it divides the values to check between each thread
approximately evenly.

    Give a number to factor.

You will need to pass parameters to your thread functions to solve
this problem.  Just use void pointers just as you did in your userspace
threading assignment.


# Thread Sorting (40 points)

Look at the thread\_sorting project in the lab directory. 

In this program you will demonstrate your understanding of thread
creation, joining, and just some general purpose concurrent algorithm
design in C.

We want time how long it takes to sort with various sort algorithms.  We'll do
this with 3 different sorting methods (all the sorting code is given
to you).  We will do this sorting in parallel using threads.  We will
print some info about how fast the various sort methods were.

The program is in the file threads.c and takes two command line arguments: 
    
1.  the number of threads to create (n),
2.  the number of numbers each thread should sort

Here's some example output from my solution:

       ./threadSort_solution.bin 6 5                                      
    Sorting indexes 0-4 with brute force
    Sorting indexes 5-9 with bubble
    Sorting indexes 10-14 with merge
    Sorting indexes 15-19 with brute force
    Sorting indexes 20-24 with bubble
    Sorting indexes 25-29 with merge
    Sorting indexes 20-24 with bubble done in 2 usecs
    Sorting indexes 15-19 with brute force done in 2 usecs
    Sorting indexes 10-14 with merge done in 78 usecs
    Sorting indexes 5-9 with bubble done in 1 usecs
    Sorting indexes 25-29 with merge done in 52 usecs
    Sorting indexes 0-4 with brute force done in 1 usecs
    brute force avg 1.500000 min 1 max 2
    bubble avg 1.500000 min 1 max 2
    merge avg 65.000000 min 52 max 78
    Result array:
    26 27 28 29 30 
    21 22 23 24 25 
    16 17 18 19 20 
    11 12 13 14 15 
    6 7 8 9 10 
    1 2 3 4 5 
    


1.  We've given you code that handles the input arguments and
    generating the numbers to sort, so you don't need to worry about
    that.

2.  Use a loop to create n parallel threads, distributing the number
    of values evenly across each thread. 
    
    Each thread will sort its group of values using a different
    sorting algorithm. In each thread, call one of three sorting
    algorithms. One third of the threads created should use a brute
    force sorting algorithm.  One third should use bubble sort. And
    finally, one third should use merge sort.  You can assume it
    divides evenly.  I built a function called thread\_dispatch that
    my pthread\_create calls.  thread\_dispatch then looks at its
    parameters to figure out which of the 3 sorting functions it ought
    to run (exactly what those parameters are though, is up to you).
    
    Make your thread\_dispatch print "Sorting indexes..." messages as
    in the example output above.  Note that I put a sleep(1) after the
    first Sorting indexes printf - this makes its obvious my threads
    run in parallel even if the sorting they do is really fast.
    
    Be sure to test this code and make sure your result array output
    matches mine before you continue one.  Don't worry about tracking
    time (the next part) till the basic sorting works.
    
3. Now make each thread track how long it takes to do the sort.
   Here's some example code for time tracking:
   
        struct timeval startt, stopt;
        suseconds_t usecs_passed;
        gettimeofday(&startt, NULL);
        // some code that takes time
        gettimeofday(&stopt, NULL);
        usecs_passed = stopt.tv_usec - startt.tv_usec;
  
    The time elapsed needs to be stored somewhere so it can be
    aggregated up after all threads are done.
    

4.  In a loop, the parent process should wait (using pthread\_join)
    for each thread to complete. Once all of the of the n threads have
    completed, the main thread calculates the maximum, minimum, and
    mean values for the execution times of each sorting algorithm.  It
    should then print these values to the console.

# Basic semaphores 1 (20 points)


## The problem

Compile and run add\_a\_lot.c.  You will see that it uses multiple
threads to repeatedly add to a global variable.  However, the final
sum is not correct because as multiple threads edit the variable they
interfere.

To be clear, a variable add looks something like this in assembly:

1.  Load the variable from memory into the register
2.  Add, possibly outputting in some other register
3.  Store the variable in the output register into memory

However, if we have multiple threads acting at once, the interleaving
can cause the count to fail.

1.  Load the variable from memory into the register (thread 1)
2.  Load the variable from memory into the register (thread 2)
3.  Add, outputting in some other register (thread 2)
4.  Store the variable in the output register into memory (thread 2)
5.  Add, outputting in some other register (thread 1)
6.  Store the variable in the output register into memory (thread 1)
    and discarding Thread 2's change


## The solution - Semaphores

You might be tempted to try to use some tricky stuff involving special
booleans to prevent concurrent modification.  We'll explain more in
future classes, but for now realize that these kind of things tend to
have their own problematic edge cases unless built very very
carefully.  Let's not do that ourselves - instead we'll use
semaphores.

Semaphores are one of a variety of concurrency synchronization
mechanisms your system might provide.  They are very powerful and
flexible, but in this assignment we'll use them in the simplest
possible way.


## Operation

Semaphores contain an internal count.  There are two operations:

1.  sem\_post - increases the count.  This has the potential to unblock
    waiting processes.
2.  sem\_wait - attempt to decrement the count.  If the count is greater
    than 1, this works and the process continues.  If the count is 0,
    the process blocks (i.e. does not return) until some other thread
    increments the count after which the thread can continue.

These are all carefully designed so that, regardless of the
interleaving of calls, the semaphore behaves consistently.  For
example, if say semaphore count\_1 is one, and two processes simultaneously
attempt to sem\_wait() on it, exactly one will be allowed to continue and
exactly one will be blocked waiting for a sem\_post.

How can we use these two operations to protect our code?  We could
make our data an actual semaphore, but that is not very flexible.
Instead, we want to use a semaphore to ensure that multiple threads
never enter our "critical section" (that is, our global increment) at
the same time.

See if you can figure out how to do this on your own without peeking
at the next section.



## Using Semaphores to protect a critical section

So the idea is that we're going to create a semaphore and initialize
its count to 1.

Then in the code we want to protect from interference, we'll to this:

1.  sem\_wait - if the count is zero that means another thread is in
    the critical section so we'll block
2.  Now we know we're the only thread in the critical section so we
    can safely update the global variables
3.  sem\_post - increment the count because we're out of the critical
    section and we want to let any other threads that are blocked to
    proceed


## Doing this in code

1.  Include the proper header
    
        #include <semaphore.h>

2.  Declare a global semaphore
    
        sem_t semaphore;

3.  In your main, initialize the semaphore with an initial count of 1
    
        sem_init(&semaphore, 0, 1);

4.  Before the code you'd like to protect starts, first wait to ensure
    you don't proceed till you have "locked" the semaphore:
    
        sem_wait(&semaphore);
    
    You'll want to make the critical section as small as possible to
     allow for maximal concurrency.

5.  After the code you'd like to protect finishes, "unlock" the
    semaphore:
    
        sem_post(&semaphore);

6.  Once you're sure all the threads are finished using the semaphore,
    clear it out (this usually happens in main after some joins):
    
        sem_destroy(&semaphore);


## Solve it!

Use the steps above to solve the problem in add\_a\_lot.c.
